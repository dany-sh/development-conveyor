### Deployment validation — 2026-07-17

- `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v`: 30 tests passed in disposable synthetic repositories.
- Both explicit state graphs were exercised edge-by-edge, including idempotent self-transitions and invalid-transition rejection.
- `scripts/conveyor validate-config`: PASS; two independent registrations; Goal Mode verified enabled.
- `scripts/conveyor run --project case-manager --mode milestone --dry-run`: PASS; next action `queue_reconciliation`; no application write.
- `scripts/conveyor run --mode portfolio --dry-run`: PASS; global concurrency `2`; no application write.
- Global skill: PASS using the skill-creator `quick_validate.py` validator with temporary, subsequently removed validator-only dependencies.
- Global agent: PASS; TOML parsed; model `gpt-5.6-terra`, reasoning `medium`, source `agent_file`.
- Application production repositories were not used by automated tests and were not modified by Conveyor setup or dry-run commands.

### Queue reconciliation repair — 2026-07-17

- Agent role: `principal-platform-architect`
- Effective model: `gpt-5.6-sol`
- Effective reasoning effort: `medium`
- Configuration source: `global_default`
- Event: `repair`
- Reason code: `case_manager_queue_reconciliation_contract`
- Scope: Development Conveyor queue discovery, parsing, corroborated `SELF` resolution, session result/exit handling, diagnostics, and controller-only recovery.
- Application boundary: Case Manager was inspected read-only; no application file, branch, commit, cycle state, or writer lease was modified.
- Deterministic coverage: 34 named reconciliation-contract tests plus the existing controller suite, using disposable synthetic repositories for all mutation cases.

### Adversarial review — 2026-07-17

- Agent role: `adversarial-reviewer`
- Effective model: `gpt-5.6-sol`
- Effective reasoning effort: `xhigh`
- Configuration source: `agent_file`
- Event: `review_and_correction`
- Initial findings: one High, four Medium, one Low.
- Corrected blocking findings: report paths now reject unsafe run IDs and prove confinement; controller-only recovery requires clean committed queue evidence on the configured milestone branch; `validation_failed` can recover to `feature_ready`; structured results come only from one marker on the terminal assistant-message line; specification paths use the explicit registered root and cannot escape through absolute, relative, symlink, queue-location, or repository-name ambiguity.
- Remaining Low: the controller repository has not undergone a Development Factory profile/bootstrap migration. This repair is a direct repository task rather than a feature or milestone Factory run; no factory lifecycle was started.

### Repair validation — 2026-07-17

- `python -m compileall src scripts`: passed in an isolated test virtual environment.
- `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v`: 65 tests passed directly from the source checkout.
- `pytest`: 65 tests passed in the isolated test virtual environment.
- `scripts/conveyor validate-config`: passed; both registered queues resolved and validated.
- `scripts/conveyor reconcile --project case-manager --dry-run`: `milestone_complete`, one P0 feature, no application write, read-only session plan.
- `scripts/conveyor run --project case-manager --mode milestone --dry-run`: P0 matched `phase-0`; P0-002 completed at `4c43aa5cd870ddb4962eceb1fbe35c648efa3e18`; no selected feature; next action `milestone_gate`.
- Controller-only state recovery moved Case Manager from the failed pilot state to `milestone_gate`; no application cycle or writer lock was created.
- Adversarial re-review: no Critical, High, or Medium findings remain.

### Stale-state reconciliation repair — 2026-07-17

- Root cause: startup trusted a persisted `milestone_gate` state after repository evidence changed, so execution attempted an invalid direct `milestone_gate -> feature_running` transition even though milestone P0 was incomplete and P0-001 was dependency-ready.
- Repair: startup now derives controller state from queue, milestone, Git, cycle, gate-provenance, and lock evidence; stale execution state is repaired only through `queue_reconciliation`, with the persisted path `milestone_gate -> queue_reconciliation -> feature_ready` before any feature launch.
- Dry-run diagnostics now report persisted state, derived state, consistency classification, proposed repair path, execution path, and whether execution would persist the repair without mutating state.
- Reservation coverage now includes reconciliation, feature launch/result processing, resume, and milestone-gate launch/finalization, with under-lock revalidation of Git, queue, selection, cycle fingerprint, worktrees, branches, and writer-lock evidence.
- Synthetic validation: `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -q` passed all 89 tests; isolated-environment `pytest` passed all 89 tests in 47.98 seconds.
- Compile validation: `python3 -m compileall src scripts` passed. The exact `python -m compileall src scripts` command was unavailable on this host because no `python` executable is installed.
- Configuration validation: `scripts/conveyor validate-config` passed with Goal Mode enabled and two registered projects.
- Live controller recovery: Case Manager moved from `milestone_gate` to `feature_ready` through `queue_reconciliation`; P0-001 remains selected, P0-002 remains completed, P0 remains incomplete, and no feature session was launched.
- Application isolation: exact before/after comparison of Case Manager tracked-file hashes, refs, branch/HEAD, cycle bytes, and writer-lock absence matched; no Case Manager file, branch, commit, cycle record, or lock changed.
- Adversarial re-review: no Critical, High, or Medium findings remain.

### CLI compatibility and failed-cycle recovery — 2026-07-17

- Root cause: the failed P0-001 repository session reached a terminal `turn.failed` event because `gpt-5.6-sol` required a newer Codex CLI. Optional MCP authentication and model-cache warnings were secondary diagnostics, not the primary cause.
- Version evidence: the failed run did not persist `codex --version`; the retained pre-upgrade executable `/Users/dany/.codex/packages/standalone/releases/0.137.0-aarch64-apple-darwin/bin/codex` reconstructs the old version as `0.137.0`. The exact current Conveyor executable is `/Users/dany/.codex/packages/standalone/releases/0.144.5-aarch64-apple-darwin/bin/codex`, version `0.144.5`.
- Model policy: feature orchestration remains explicitly pinned to `gpt-5.6-sol` with `high` reasoning from the `feature-factory-orchestrator` agent policy. No model or reasoning fallback was introduced.
- Preflight: `scripts/conveyor doctor` and `scripts/conveyor doctor --project case-manager` both classified the current exact executable, model, and reasoning combination as `compatible` before recovery.
- Failure and retry disposition: run `555d458b-b52d-43ee-8aa2-dde097df4c77`, session `019f7264-c6e8-7591-b79f-253cb162cc65`, and its three focused retries are preserved as an exhausted, non-retryable `cli_upgrade_required` cycle. The old session will not resume.
- Repair: session plans now record and pass the exact executable, model, reasoning, and compatibility result; deterministic compatibility failures receive no automatic retry; repository-scoped retries require a validated allowlisted failure contract, a changed hypothesis, supporting evidence, and materially different remediation; exhaustion is explicit.
- Cycle safety: a null feature integration base resolves to verified milestone HEAD, launch invariants are validated before `feature_running`, action-specific session IDs prevent cross-role resume, and a replaced historical cycle is archived byte-for-byte with a SHA-256 record before the active-cycle slot changes.
- Live controller recovery: Case Manager moved from stale `feature_running` through the verified recovery path to `feature_ready`. P0-001 remains selected and its required start is `826de2ab2c517e4bba53ed54f0cf2ddee50f38ef`. No repository session launched.
- Application isolation: before/after Case Manager tracked manifest `4a62a08d58b47e9daffc32d98d294dce4c12aeff249ddcfe48177c2a945b26c9`, refs `6ecf48727b3f481c045f7bdcc33131edc9f4fc7679eff5d6c230b6fb1c0a18c1`, cycle bytes `1b0fdf9177a2d36edcaa5b6b3d0e2f91d89b4ee69bdba369afb56784ba07d679`, branch `codex/p0-foundation`, HEAD, single worktree, clean status, and writer-lock absence matched exactly. Historical report hashes also matched.
- Validation: `python3 -m compileall -q src scripts`, all 117 unittest cases, all 117 pytest cases in an isolated temporary environment, `scripts/conveyor validate-config`, both doctor commands, current status, and the final resume dry-run passed.
- Final dry-run: state is consistent at `feature_ready`; P0-001 is selected; the next real feature cycle would start a new repository-scoped session, never resume the failed session, and the dry-run performed no application write, lock acquisition, or Git operation.
- Adversarial re-review: no Critical, High, or Medium findings remain after correcting action-specific recovery, retry-contract classification, retry exhaustion, immutable cycle archival, and authentication-diagnostic redaction.

### Feature-branch invariant and dirty-cycle recovery — 2026-07-17

- Root cause: run `99c2f421-6b5a-4f8a-ae43-a5aefc12657e` persisted the expected P0-001 branch name but launched the repository session while the registered worktree was still on `codex/p0-foundation`. A zero process exit then advanced the checkpoint without an accepted commit, while the writer lease was no longer present.
- Launch repair: the controller now derives or validates the expected branch, creates or selects it at the verified feature starting commit, verifies the actual branch/worktree and unchanged milestone ref, persists both, and acquires a Feature-Factory-compatible writer lease before `feature_running` or session launch. The lease remains through accepted-commit verification.
- Completion repair: a zero exit is classified from Git, worktree, lease, and queue evidence. Integration is authorized only after `accepted_feature` proves exactly one accepted commit; branch, dirty-work, missing-commit, missing-queue, incomplete-result, and unsupported completion claims remain recoverable without integration.
- Continuation repair: a recovered normal session may resume only after branch/worktree verification and writer-lease reacquisition. Its prompt states that prior completion was uncorroborated, requires implementation, validation, adversarial review, queue/documentation updates, and exactly one accepted commit, and forbids milestone integration until controller verification.
- Synthetic validation: `python3 -m compileall src scripts`, `git diff --check`, all 135 unittest cases, and all 135 pytest cases passed. Pytest ran from a disposable temporary virtual environment because the host has no installed `pytest` command or module.
- Configuration and live dry-run validation: `scripts/conveyor validate-config`, `scripts/conveyor status --project case-manager`, and `scripts/conveyor resume --project case-manager --dry-run` passed. Before recovery the dry-run classified `branch_invariant_violated` with `uncommitted_feature_work`, required branch recovery and a future writer lock, and denied resume.
- Controlled Case Manager recovery: `recover-feature-branch` recorded the three dirty-file hashes, used only non-forced `git switch -c`, created `codex/p0-001-decide-and-record-the-per-case-persistence-authority` at `826de2ab2c517e4bba53ed54f0cf2ddee50f38ef`, preserved all three hashes and dirty entries byte-for-byte, and left `codex/p0-foundation` at the same commit. Report: `reports/99c2f421-6b5a-4f8a-ae43-a5aefc12657e/feature-branch-recovery.json`.
- Final live state: P0-001 remains `ready`; `accepted_feature_commit` remains null; the three original files remain modified; no Git operation or writer lease exists; no repository session launched; `branch_recovery_required` is false; `writer_lock_required_before_resume` is true; and `resume_allowed_after_lock` is true.
